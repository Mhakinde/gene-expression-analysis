🧬 Gene Expression Analysis and VisualizationThis project demonstrates a foundational bioinformatics pipeline for identifying and visualizing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two biological conditions using Python. This is a core skill set for processing transcriptomic data from platforms like microarrays or RNA sequencing.Project GoalTo perform Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) on simulated data, mimicking the structure of a public GEO dataset, and to visualize the results using industry-standard plots (Volcano Plot and Heatmap).Dataset SourceGEO Accession: GSE68849 (Primary Breast Cancer vs. Normal Tissue)Data Used: A synthetic dataset was generated in the script (gene_expression_analysis.py) to replicate the structure, sample groups (4 Control, 4 Disease), and expected differential expression patterns of the real GEO dataset. This allows the script to be run immediately in environments like Google Colab without complex data download steps.Analysis Methods & TechnologiesThe analysis pipeline adheres to standard best practices in gene expression analysis:1. Data Wrangling & Quality ControlLibrary: pandasSteps: Loading expression data and phenotype information, ensuring data integrity (e.g., checking for null values), and splitting the data matrix into Control and Disease groups.2. Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy.statsLog2 Fold Change (Log2FC): Calculated as $\log_2(\frac{\text{Mean Expression}_{\text{Disease}}}{\text{Mean Expression}_{\text{Control}}})$ for each gene.Statistical Testing: A two-sample Welch's T-test (scipy.stats.ttest_ind with equal_var=False) was used to determine the significance (p-value) of the difference between the two group means.Multiple Testing Correction: Bonferroni correction was applied to the raw p-values to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The adjusted p-value (adj_p_value) is used for determining significance.3. VisualizationLibraries: matplotlib.pyplot, seabornVolcano Plot: Plots Log2FC (x-axis) versus $-\log_{10}(\text{Adjusted P-value})$ (y-axis). Genes passing the significance thresholds are colored red.Heatmap: Visualizes the relative expression (Z-scores) of the top 20 DEGs across all samples, demonstrating clear cluster separation between Control and Disease groups.Key Insights and ResultsThe differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined by the following criteria:$|\text{Log2FC}| \geq 0.5$Adjusted P-value $\leq 0.05$RegulationKey Simulated GeneReal-World Biological RelevanceUp-regulatedMYC, EGFROften oncogenes; their increased expression drives cell proliferation and is highly characteristic of many cancers.Down-regulatedBRCA1A key tumor suppressor gene; reduced expression often leads to genomic instability and contributes to cancer development.The script successfully identified these genes as significant, validating the analysis pipeline.Skills Highlightedpandas (Data Wrangling)numpy & scipy (Statistical Analysis)seaborn & matplotlib (Data Visualization)Biological InterpretationReproducible Research (GitHub deployment)
